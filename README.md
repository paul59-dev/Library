# Java Library Simulation

This Java project simulates a library system with features for managing books and users. The code is structured into three main classes: `Book`, `User`, and `Library`.

## Book

The `Book` class represents a book with attributes such as ISBN, title, author, and an availability indicator. Books can be borrowed and returned.

## User

The `User` class represents a library user with attributes like name, user ID, and a list of borrowed books. Users can borrow and return books.

## Library

The `Library` class represents the library itself, with lists of books and users. It provides methods to add books and users, as well as to display the list of available books and library users.

## Usage

The `App.java` file contains a `main` method that creates an instance of `Library`, books, and users, adds them to the library, and demonstrates basic interactions such as borrowing and returning books.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Run the `App.java` file to see the library simulation in action.

Feel free to customize and expand upon this code for your own projects or learning purposes.
